# Network Foundations

This repository documents foundational networking concepts through
packet-flow reasoning and fault isolation.

The goal is to understand how networks behave, how traffic moves,
and how failures occur - independent of vendor tools or platforms.

This work serves as the base layer for future security
and cloud studies.

---

## Scope
- Packet flow (OSI and TCP/IP models)
- IP addressing and subnetting
- Switching and routing logic
- Core network services (ARP, DNS, DHCP)
- Common failure modes and troubleshooting patterns

## Method
Each section focuses on:
- What is happening
- Why it happens
- What breaks when it fails
- How to reason through the failure

This repository emphasizes understanding over configuration.
